# How to make your ROM available on Osprey roms app?

## Why would you want to make your ROM available in the first place?
ROM developers usually compile ROMs as a hobby. Some developers leave a donation link. But that's not a guarenteed way to earn anything.  
I absolutely respect the amazing work of developers. This app is a result of my idea of allowing devs to earn by using <b>Google Admob</b> ad units, placed in the app.  
<b><i>If this is not a violation of Google Admob policies, then developers will need to:
  1. Create an Admob account
  2. Make a banner ad.
  3. Send me the banner ad id along with other information.
The ROM page of the developer will have a banner ad with the given id. So whenever someone opens the ROM page of your ROM, your ad will make impressions and you will earn some revenue.</b></i>
